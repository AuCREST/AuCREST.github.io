Our research focuses on solving computational and mathematical problems
associated with improving election security, integrity, and trustworthiness.
This includes developing methodologies for risk-limiting post-election audits
for various election systems, and algorithms for analysing the properties of
elections, such as the margin of victory. 


## Voting Schemes

Our research primarily considers election systems in which voters rank
candidates according to their preferences, commonly referred to as preferential
or ranked-choice elections. 

### Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)

Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is a preferential, or ranked-choice, voting scheme. 
Voters cast a ballot in which they *rank* the
set of candidates from most to least preferred. Depending on the jurisdiction,
each vote may express a total, or partial, order over the set of candidates.
Each ballot represents a single vote. 

An IRV election is tabulated in rounds. In the first round, each candidate has a
tally pile consisting of all the ballots on which they have been ranked first
(highest). The number of ballots in this pile (the number of votes) represents 
their *first preference tally*. While no candidate
has the majority of votes, the candidate with the smallest tally is
*eliminated*. All ballots in their tally pile are then given to the next most
preferred eligible candidate on the ballot. A candidate is eligible to receive
new ballots in their pile if they are still standing (not yet eliminated).
Ballots with no further elibigle candidates in their ranking become *exhausted*.
When one candidate has the majority of votes, they are declared the winner.
Alternatively, we can continue to eliminated the candidate with the smallest
tally until one candidate remains. This last remaining candidate is declared the
winner.
 

### Single Transferable Vote (STV)

## Risk Limiting Audits

Risk limiting audits (RLAs) are a post-election activity, performed to provide a certain level of confidence
in the correctness of the reported outcome, or to correct a wrong outcome by manual recount. These
audits involve randomly sampling paper ballots that have been cast by voters. After collecting and
analysing such a sample, statistical computations are performed to ascertain a current level of risk. A
Risk Limiting Audit guarantees a *risk limit*: the maximum probability that it will mistakenly confirm a
reported outcome that was in fact wrong. The audit proceeds by sampling ballots until this risk falls
below an acceptable level, or election administrators determine that a full manual count is required.

### RAIRE

**R**isk limiting **A**udits for **IR**V **E**lections (RAIRE) allows election administrators to conduct Risk Limiting
Audits (RLAs) for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. This work introduced
the concept of an *assertion-based* audit. An assertion is a mathematical
statement, comparing two tallies in a specific context. These two tallies may be
the tallies of two candidates in the context where we assume a certain subset of
candidates are still standing. Given digitised preferences for the ballots cast
in an IRV election, RAIRE identifies a set of assertions that, if verified in an
RLA, imply that the announced (reported) winner won. RAIRE uses a
branch-and-bound algorithm to find a set of assertions that require auditors to
sample the least number of ballots. 

RAIRE has been piloted in a number of
US-based IRV elections: the 2019 San Francisco District Attorney contest; three
2020 Democratic Presidential Primaries; and a Mayoral Contest in Boulder,
Colorado, in November 2023. 

From 2025, RAIRE will be used to audit IRV elections
taking place in Colorado, United States, through a project with the Australian
not-for-profit [Democracy
Developers](https://www.democracydevelopers.org.au/about-us/). For an accessible
introduction to RLAs with RAIRE, see the [Guide to RAIRE Part
