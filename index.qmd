Collaborative Research for Election Security and Trustworthiness Group (CREST)

We work on a range of topics related to election integrity, including
developing methods and software to:

- Determine how close an election was.
- Check the outcome of an election via an election audit.

We are based in Melbourne, Australia, and work with collaborators from many
other countries.
